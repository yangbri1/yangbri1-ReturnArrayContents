     * Return a string with an array's contents, formatted with spaces.
     * For example, given the array {3,4,5,6} the string should look like this:
     * 3 4 5 6
     *
     * Spaces at the end of the string will not affect test results.
     *
     * You will need to use a for loop here. Again, the structure of that loop would look similar to a previous problem.
     * However, this challenge introduces the idea that a for loop can manipulate a variable that exists outside of the
     * for loop, which looks something like this:
     *
     * String str;
     * for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++){
     *      //do something to str here
     * }
     * return str;
     *
     * Where i represents a variable that is used to visit every number between 0 and the length of nums. Inside of the
     * for loop, you will need to write code that appends elements from nums to str, one by one, in the format described
     * above.
     *
     * After completing the problem, I recommend using your IDE's debugger to walk through the loop. The debugger will
     * allow you to step through the code and help you visualize the values as they change over time. We recommend that
     * you review the Visual Studio Code Debugging documentation: https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging
     * to get a better understanding of how to use these tools. Debugging is an important process and is critical for 
     * your success in future coding challenges and as a developer.
     *
     * @param nums the array to be manipulated.
     * @return a string representation of all values of nums, with the values separated by spaces.
